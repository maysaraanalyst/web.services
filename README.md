This document provides instructions for installing the LEMP stack (Nginx, MariaDB, PHP) on AlmaLinux using a shell script (`lemp.install.sh`).

**Requirements:**

* AlmaLinux system with root or sudo privileges
* Internet access

**Installation Steps:**

1. Save the provided script `lemp.install.sh` to your AlmaLinux server.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x lemp.install.sh`
3. Run the script with root privileges: `sudo ./lemp.install.sh`
  - The script will guide you through the installation process, including setting a root password for MariaDB.
